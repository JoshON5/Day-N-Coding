# Day N Coding

Using starter code, this application was deployed to help keep a schedule of errands need to-do throughout the day. Each hour between 9am-5pm is mapped out into each individual block with a text area and a save button attaced at the end. When the save button is clicked, the text should save and remain even after a refresh of the page. If the hour has already past, then the block background will be gray, if it is present, then the background will be red, and if it is a future time, then the background will be green. This function was created by using day.js.
